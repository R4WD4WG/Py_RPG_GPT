## Development Process

This project is a delightful fusion of human and AI creativity. ðŸŽ¨ Our author, R4WD4WG, fed prompts to ChatGPT & Bard and received valuable programming advice. Not only that, but the AI was also granted some creative control over the story, writing engaging dialogues for NPCs, and more. ðŸ“š GitHub's CoPilot technology joined the party to generate and automate code writing, making the whole process feel like a futuristic coding jam session. ðŸš€

## Development Status

This project is still being updated. We'll let you know when our AI friends decide to take a break! ðŸ˜„

## Acknowledgements

A huge shoutout to our AI buddies: OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Bard, and GitHub's CoPilot. Without their guidance, quirky suggestions, and creative contributions, this project wouldn't be the same. High fives all around! ðŸ™Œ
